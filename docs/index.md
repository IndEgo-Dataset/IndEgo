## About

**IndEgo** combines Egocentric AI, Vision-Language Models, and Robotics-aware reasoning to understand human actions and provide real-time guidance. It is designed for use in industrial settings through smart glasses or mobile devices — enabling contextual assistance, task verification, and human-robot collaboration.

IndEgo supports use cases such as:
- Industrial task training and onboarding  
- Real-time guidance and error prevention  
- Knowledge transfer from experts to new operators  
- AI-augmented collaboration between workers and machines  

Built as a privacy-first, open-source project, IndEgo gives organizations full control over data, deployment, and customization.

## Technology

IndEgo runs on an adaptable framework that leverages:
- **Egocentric computer vision** for task context understanding  
- **Vision-language models (VLMs)** for multi-modal reasoning and interaction  
- **Robotics-aware logic** to align human guidance with automated systems  
- **Smart glasses or mobile devices** for real-time, on-site use
